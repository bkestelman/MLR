# MLR

Machine Learning Research in C++

Machine learning algorithms built from scratch with all their moving parts exposed. The aim is to methodically learn how each component of an algorithm affects its performance, against different types of data. 

## Progress Summary

### ANN:
- Backpropagation
- Choice of activation function (currently either noFunc or sigmoid)
- Tested on logical AND
- TODO: init weights randomly (currently all 0)
- TODO: batch input training (currently one at a time)

### Data:
- TODO: adaptor interface to feed data to algorithms
